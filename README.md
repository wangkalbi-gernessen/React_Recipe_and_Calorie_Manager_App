## About

## Why I created this app
I created this app to show my developing skill.  
I can write clean codes in JavaScript with good architecture which makes the app sustainable and testable.

I can also make beautiful layout using Material Ui. I used to use Material UI before but Material UI is better to make efficient and responsive layout.

Recipe-and-Calorie-Manager looks simple but it has so many features.  
Obviously it requires internet connection and showing posts in list furthermore uploading image file with caption. 
They are basic features of app but you can also add more features such as uploading videos, adding filter to images if you want.  
That's why I imagined this is good theme to investigate some technologies which I've never done.
